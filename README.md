# lane-departure-warning
In driving assistance system obstacle detection especially for moving object detection is a key component of collision avoidance. Many sensors can be used for obstacle detection and lane detection, such as laser, radar and vision sensors. The most frequently used principle approach to detect road boundaries and lane using vision system on the vehicle. The system acquires the front view using a camera mounted on the vehicle then applying few processes in order to detect the lanes and objects .The processed image is displayed on the LCD screen. In vision based lane departure warning system, a camera is placed behind the wind shield of the vehicle and images of road are captured. The lines on the road are interpreted and lanes are identified.
